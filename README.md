# MERN Stack Authentication App

This project is a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack application that focuses on authentication. It provides user functionalities such as signing up, logging in, and logging out while offering access to protected routes exclusively for authenticated users.

## Overview

The front-end of the application is developed using React and implements React Router for efficient client-side routing. On the other hand, the back-end is created with Node.js and Express, utilizing MongoDB as the primary database. Authentication mechanisms are implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

## Purpose

This application serves as a robust starting point for anyone keen on building full-stack web applications that include authentication through the MERN stack. You're encouraged to leverage it as a template for your personal or professional projects.

## Features

- User authentication (sign up, log in, log out)
- Protected routes for authenticated users
- React-based front-end with React Router for seamless navigation
- Node.js and Express back-end with MongoDB as the database
- JWT-based authentication implementation

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`
3. Run the front-end and back-end servers `npm run dev`
4. Customize the application based on your requirements
